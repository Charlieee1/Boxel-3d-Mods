Curator's notes:  
This level was made to show Charlieee1 that Outerbound could make a better platformer level in 3 minutes. Both players believe Charlie's level is better.  
Curator's description:  
```A series of bouncing spikes, probably inspired from Doppler's "Boxel Nomad" level, followed by a tight navigation through spikes. Or avoid all of it with the easy, obvious cheese of going underneath the level.```

Curator's notes:  
The author is the first person to discover that html can be put into text boxes for boxel 3d levels. The level is a meme level featuring simple platforming and spider gameplay, and a twerking among us gif in a text box.  
Curator's description:  
```A drop into a single platforming jump, a gravity change, and then a spider block. From there pathfind to the finish as quickly as possible.```

Curator's notes:  
The author is an excellent level builder. This level is made trivial by multiple cheeses. The beginning of this level is very laggy, so beware of opening it on a weaker device.  
Curator's description:  
```Travel in an approximate straight line through a field of floating obstacles, and do your best not to hit any on your way to the finish. Finishes with an older version of Kllixto's signature ending model.```

Curator's notes:  
The author is an excellent level builder. This level is made easy by multiple cheeses. The beginning of this level relies somewhat on RNG.  
Curator's description:  
```Chaos, and tricky gamplay unless you cheese it.```.
### Box Escape
Author: DonW15  
Description:  
```Kind of gimmicky escape room I created in 2022 but never did much with```  
Extra info:

Difficulty: 7  
Download: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=17uk5rAwOl5-dejIG63nPn-VtukO2gPBg)  
Curator's notes:  
The author is well known as an excellent boxel 3d player. To date, he is the only one to have beaten every Kackiest Kacky level. This level inspired the first obstacle of Kackiest Kacky #-1. Doppler may be planning to add this level into the game.  
Curator's description:  
```Don't get mad as you miss the size change block, and then repeatedly fail the last jump.```
### Course Of Stress
Author: Justabox  
Description:  
```Stress is not they key.```  
Extra info:  
```No```  
Difficulty: 0  
Download: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EScqZ1iwZQeRCSh7eChXWfyrPjAe7i8Y)  
Curator's notes:  
An amateur level, shown by having many small blocks instead of large blocks, and unintuitive jumps. Don't blame yourself if you are annoyed at random slowdowns or speedups, or can't figure out how to make the jumps. Otherwise, this level could have been added into the game.  
Curator's description:  
```A linear level with some interesting platforming elements. Anticipate glitchy movement.```
### Down, Up, Swing
Author: Memesbro  
Description:  
```A short level which involves dropping down, floating up, and swinging to the finish!```  
Extra info:  
```While the difficulty is put down as 7, it could be harder or easier depending on who is playing```  
```This is an updated version of Down, Up, Swing. I couldn't replace the JSON file in my previous response, so use this one please```

Download (nerfed): [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1c94oA7rky224YJP95CsMCDnMaSb89qPk)  
Curator's notes:  
This level, when first released, was found by the community to have multiple shorcuts. After multiple patches, the final version got released. Above, there is also the download for the nerfed version of the level. The unnerfed version is the official version.  
Curator's description:  
```The first part is trivial. Then it's followed by extremely tight gaps in spikes that you must get through with spider mode enabled, upside down, and with a force block trying to kill you.```
### Dragon-01
Author: Charlieee1  
Description:  
```A GD-like level where your cube is hidden most of the time (not very fun). Also includes tutorial.```  
Extra info:  
```First level in boxel 3d to include hidden gameplay and tutorial (to my knowledge)```  
Difficulty: 3  
Download: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uQzrYcRehP2aarHhDCI5OZcSLAinWW3A)  
Curator's notes:  
Due to not being able to see the player most of the level, the gameplay is annoying and not very fun. Includes very similar gameplay to `Something` by Kllixto. It is unknown who created this type of gameplay first.  
Curator's description:  
```Enter through the head of a dragon and go through the obstacle maze inside, only knowing when to jump from handy arrows on the dragon's body. Exit through the top and complete a short platforming course to finish the level.```

Curator's notes:  
Upon release, the level gained near-instant popularity within the boxel community. Doppler may be planning to add this level into the game.  
Curator's description:  
```A very fun somewhat linear level that uses a great deal of verticality. It is highly recommended to play this platforming level.```

Curator's notes:  
Try not to be confused as this level tries to lead you away from the intended path, and has somewhat awkward jumps. A fun platforming challenge to kill some time.  
Curator's description:  
```The intended path is underneath the trick path, so follow it to the finish. Feel free to use the editor view to plan your jumps ahead of time.```
### Its Just Wonkers/Its Just Very Long

An amateur level, shown by having many small blocks instead of large blocks, and unintuitive jumps. Don't blame yourself if you are annoyed at random slowdowns or speedups, or can't figure out how to make the jumps. Otherwise, this level could have been added into the game. Very similar to `Course of Stress` by the same author  
Curator's description:  
```A linear level with some interesting platforming elements. Anticipate glitchy movement.```

Curator's notes:  
Mash your jump button into oblivion. Very similar to tippy-tap.

```Spend a long time spamming to get the far finish, or quickly get the relatively easily accessible risky finish.```

Curator's notes:

Download: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gzfD9-we43IKCdfV1YwKM3Ml9PsAc5p1)  
Curator's notes:  
This level is trivial with the well known shortcut. When this creator says "game", they mean "level". One text box is even more immature than the text box in `Awesome Parkour Twerk`.  
Curator's description:  
```Jump off the beginning ramp to go backwards, upside down, to get an easy 4 second run.```

Curator's notes:  
The author is an excellent level builder. This is a popular level, and multiple players have grinded for excellent times. As of 04/15/2024, this level has been added into the game. Source: [Discord link](https://discord.com/channels/855086881778827294/933865169182949417/1229450908946137239)

Curator's notes:  
Kargoh's bobsled on steroids. When released, this was peak RNG in a boxel 3d level.  
Curator's description:  
```A box, where you have almost no control.```
### The Tower

Curator's notes:  
A harder version of `The Tower` by the same author. A very hard map. Charlieee1 should not have suggested the addition of spikes...  
This level has 0 verifiers so far, and for good reason...  
Curator's description:  
```A mind-bogglingly hard spider level with a lot of spikes.```

## Kackiest Kacky
Kackiest Kacky is an event hosted to this day by Charlieee1. It aims to collect the hardest levels and the most obscure glitches in boxel 3d. Can you beat all levels?  
Additional information that is included with some levels:
- First verifier (where it is not the author)
- Verifiers (only for the hardest levels)
- Author time

Curator's notes:  
As the very first kackiest kacky map, this level set the standard for future kacky levels. It also introduced a new fancy endscreen that would become the standard for most kacky levels. The first obstacle is much harder than the rest of the level.  
IMPORTANT: To verify this level, players must submit a recording, and using checkpoint respawn is BANNED from use in this level.  
Curator's description:  
```Hard.```

Curator's notes:  
This level is more fun than #-1, and DonW15, the only verifier of both levels, has deemed it harder.  
Curator's description:  
```A fast-paced level with precise timings and platforming, ending with a spider section.```

Curator's notes:  
Instead of going for difficulty, this level showcases the double jump glitch. This means that it is possible to hunt for a low time, which some players have done.  
Curator's description:  
```A jump, followed by another jump.```
