Curator's notes:

The author is an excellent level builder. This level is made trivial by multiple cheeses. The beginning of this level is very laggy, so beware of opening it on a weaker device.  
Curator's description:  
```Travel in an approximate straight line through a field of floating obstacles, and do your best not to hit any on your way to the finish. Finishes with an older version of Kllixto's signature ending model.```

Curator's notes:  
The author is an excellent level builder. This level is made easy by multiple cheeses. The beginning of this level relies somewhat on RNG.  
Curator's description:  
```Chaos, and tricky gamplay unless you cheese it.```.
### Box Escape
Author: DonW15  
Description:  
```Kind of gimmicky escape room I created in 2022 but never did much with```

Difficulty: 7  
Download: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=17uk5rAwOl5-dejIG63nPn-VtukO2gPBg)  
Curator's notes:  
The author is well known as an excellent boxel 3d player. To date, he is the only one to have beaten every Kackiest Kacky level. This level inspired the first obstacle of Kackiest Kacky #-1. Doppler may be planning to add this level into the game.  
Curator's description:  
```Don't get mad as you miss the size change block, and then repeatedly fail the last jump.```
### Course Of Stress
Author: Justabox  
Description:  
```Stress is not they key.```  
Extra info:  
```No```  
Difficulty: 0  
Download: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EScqZ1iwZQeRCSh7eChXWfyrPjAe7i8Y)  
Curator's notes:  
An amateur level, shown by having many small blocks instead of large blocks, and unintuitive jumps. Don't blame yourself if you are annoyed at random slowdowns or speedups, or can't figure out how to make the jumps. Otherwise, this level could have been added into the game.  
Curator's description:  
```A linear level with some interesting platforming elements. Anticipate glitchy movement.```
### Down, Up, Swing
Author: Memesbro  
Description:  
```A short level which involves dropping down, floating up, and swinging to the finish!```  
Extra info:  
```While the difficulty is put down as 7, it could be harder or easier depending on who is playing```  
```This is an updated version of Down, Up, Swing. I couldn't replace the JSON file in my previous response, so use this one please```  
Difficulty: 8  
Download: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_rDZwKhuTjDjxvrgV15p_3sPdX27OcZz)  
Download (nerfed): [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1c94oA7rky224YJP95CsMCDnMaSb89qPk)  
Curator's notes:  
This level, when first released, was found by the community to have multiple shorcuts. After multiple patches, the final version got released. Above, there is also the download for the nerfed version of the level. The unnerfed version is the official version.  
Curator's description:  
```The first part is trivial. Then it's followed by extremely tight gaps in spikes that you must get through with spider mode enabled, upside down, and with a force block trying to kill you.```
### Dragon-01
Author: Charlieee1  
Description:  
```A GD-like level where your cube is hidden most of the time (not very fun). Also includes tutorial.```  
Extra info:  
```First level in boxel 3d to include hidden gameplay and tutorial (to my knowledge)```  
Difficulty: 3  
Download: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uQzrYcRehP2aarHhDCI5OZcSLAinWW3A)  
Curator's notes:  
Due to not being able to see the player most of the level, the gameplay is annoying and not very fun. Includes very similar gameplay to `Something` by Kllixto. It is unknown who created this type of gameplay first.  
Curator's description:  
```Enter through the head of a dragon and go through the obstacle maze inside, only knowing when to jump from handy arrows on the dragon's body. Exit through the top and complete a short platforming course to finish the level.```

Curator's notes:  
Upon release, the level gained near-instant popularity within the boxel community. Doppler may be planning to add this level into the game.

Don't blame yourself if you are annoyed at random slowdowns or speedups, or can't figure out how to make the jumps. Otherwise, this level could have been added into the game. Very similar to `Course of Stress` by the same author  
Curator's description:  
```A linear level with some interesting platforming elements. Anticipate glitchy movement.```

Curator's notes:  
Mash your jump button into oblivion. Very similar to tippy-tap.  
Curator's description:  
```Spend a long time spamming to get the far finish, or quickly get the relatively easily accessible risky finish.```
### My first level
Author: Ayman_gx  
Description:  
```anyone who has enough mental power to try the first level i ever made ?```  
Extra info: None  
Difficulty: 1

Author: Skittle-chan

Difficulty: 0  
Download: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gzfD9-we43IKCdfV1YwKM3Ml9PsAc5p1)  
Curator's notes:  
This level is trivial with the well known shortcut. When this creator says "game", they mean "level". One text box is even more immature than the text box in `Awesome Parkour Twerk`.  
Curator's description:  
```Jump off the beginning ramp to go backwards, upside down, to get an easy 4 second run.```

Curator's description:  
```Get into a small tube, where you must play through the main part of the level, similar to ball gameplay in Geometry Dash. Then try to not die on the troll spike at the end.```

Extra info: Unknown

Curator's notes:  
Kargoh's bobsled on steroids. When released, this was peak RNG in a boxel 3d level.  
Curator's description:  
```A box, where you have almost no control.```

Curator's notes:  
A harder version of `The Tower` by the same author. A very hard map. Charlieee1 should not have suggested the addition of spikes...  
This level has 0 verifiers so far, and for good reason...  
Curator's description:  
```A mind-bogglingly hard spider level with a lot of spikes.```
